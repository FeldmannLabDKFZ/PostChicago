\title{Create Bedgraphs From ChicagoData}
\usage{
makeBedGraphs(
  id,
  L_data,
  rmapgr,
  baited_genes,
  ints = NULL,
  L_norm = NULL,
  outputDir = "bedgraph"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{baitID, must correspond to the baitIDs defined in baited_genes and the supplied rmapgr object}

\item{L_data}{list of ChicagoData (cd) objects}

\item{rmapgr}{GenomicRanges object containing restriction fragments. IDs must be saved in a column called 'id'}

\item{baited_genes}{GenomicRanges object containing the information on view points (baited genes);
usually generated from the .baitmap (see Chicago package), using for instance baitmap2baited_genes()}

\item{ints}{optional, table containing all interactions across L_data, if supplied, a separate bed file containing all
interactions mapping to the bait defined by id is created}

\item{L_norm}{list of cd objects which should be used to normalize samples, useful if bedgraphs are to be created only
for a subset of promoters or genomic locations, as it keeps the normalization constant to the whole dataset. Default: L_data}

\item{outputDir}{output directory for bedgraphs, automatically created if not surrently present; Default: 'bedgraph'}
}
\value{
Saves bedgraphs for the bait defined by id for each sample and a bedfile containing the view point.
}
\description{
Takes ChicagoData objects supplied in the list L, normalizes them to read coverage mapped to baits.
Creates two file types. 1) A bedgraph file containing normalized reads for each sample mapping to the bait defined by id.
2) Creates a bed file of the view point (bait).
