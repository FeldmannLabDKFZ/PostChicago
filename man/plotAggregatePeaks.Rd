\usage{
plotAggregatePeaks(
  Lm,
  mainprefix = NULL,
  col = NULL,
  ylim = NULL,
  lty = NULL,
  xlim = NULL,
  k = 3,
  ylab = "normalised reads",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Lm}{List of matrices containing interaction reads or scores}

\item{mainprefix}{Optional; text added to the plot title.}

\item{col}{Optional; colour for the aggregate plots. Default contains four colours.}

\item{ylim}{Optional; Default data-driven}

\item{lty}{Optional; line type for the aggregate plots}

\item{xlim}{Optional; should be added in restriction fragments surrounding the interval/peak center. Example: c(-50,50).
Default: All restriction fragments represented in the matrix.}

\item{k}{Numeric; over how many fargments should the running mean be calculated? Default: 3}

\item{ylab}{Optional. Default: 'normalised reads'}

\item{plotwhat}{What plots to plot? Options are 'all','mean','median'
'mean' and 'median' plot running averages over k fragments.
Default: 'all': Four plots representing mean and median read counts both smoothed and unsmoothed.}
