\usage{
getDataInPeaks(
  grl,
  resfolder = "matrices/",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  infolder = "",
  zoom
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{Genomic Ranges List containing intervals for which interaction frequencies should be quantified. Typically a list of ChIP-Seq peaks.}

\item{resfolder}{Path to the directory in which matrices are stored. Default: 'matrices/'. Creates the directory if necessary. Note that the names of the matrix lists are extracted from the names of intervals in grl. Therefore, if creating matrices from Capture-C replicates, it is recommended to use a separate resfolder, such as 'matrices_reps/'}

\item{overwrite}{Should helper tables be overwritten? Refers to the helper tables that detail under which restriction fragments the quantification should occur. Default: FALSE.}

\item{infolder}{Path to the directory in which oneGeneOnePeak files are stored. Default: Current working directory.}

\item{zoom}{Zoom in restriction fragments, for which the matrices were quantified by getMatrix()}
}
\value{
Saved annotated OneGeneOnePeak tables. Extension from resfolder is used to save the table (e.g. if resfolder='matrices_reps/', the extension '_reps' is used).
}
\description{
Quantifies reads and scores under interaction peaks, which can be defined
either as interactions with some features (i.e. Ring1b peaks) or as interaction peak empirically determined.
Reads and scores are quantified in 3 ways: 1) sum value of all restriction fragments under the peak, 2) mean
value of all restriction fragments under a peak and 3) value in the peak summit.
