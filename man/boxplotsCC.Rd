\title{Plot Quantification of OneGeneOnePeak Interactions}
\usage{
boxplotsCC(grl = NULL, resfolder, infolder = "", l = NULL, col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{Optional, named GRangesList containing features that were quantified for the boxplot. Doesn't need to be provided if a 
list of quantification tables (l) is provided}

\item{resfolder}{Folder where interaction matrices are saved}

\item{infolder}{Folder where the tables with feature interaction quantifications are stored.}

\item{l}{Optional, list with readsScoresInPeak tables from which to make plots. Only needs to be provided if grl is not provided.}

\item{col}{Optional color}
}
\value{
boxplots of scores and reads of each experiment of a specific feature
}
\description{
Plots scores and reads of each experiment
}
\examples{
# example code

#requires precomputed matrices in the resfolder (see getMatrix())
extdata <- system.file("extdata", package="PostChicago")
outputDir <- file.path(extdata,'postchicago')
quantfolder=paste0(outputDir,'/oneGeneOnePeak')
resfolder=paste0(outputDir,'/matrices/')
intDir <- file.path(extdata,'intervals')

#Load intervals for which the boxplots should be quantified into a GRangesList 
grl <- suppressWarnings(loadGrl(intDir = intDir))

#Quantify interactions under the peaks in grl to generate quantification tables:
#dip=getDataInPeaks(grl[grep('K27ac',names(grl))],resfolder=resfolder, 
#infolder = quantfolder, overwrite=FALSE, zoom = 100)

#Read in interaction quantification tables into a list where each table represents the quantification
#over one set of intercals in grl:
df=read.delim(paste0(quantfolder, '/quantReadsScoresInPeak_K27ac_peaks.txt'),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
quantlist=list(K27ac_peaks=df)

#Plot boxplots of these quantifications
boxplotsCC(grl[grep('K27ac',names(grl))],resfolder=resfolder, infolder=outputDir, l=quantlist)
