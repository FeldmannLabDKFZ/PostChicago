\usage{
annotateInts(ints, grl, minov = NULL, maxgp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ints}{a table with interactions, for example derived from Chicago Data tables, for instance by using getInts().
assumes six named columns:
'seqnames_bait','start_bait','end_bait' (coordinates of the baited restriction fragment) and
'seqnames_otherEnd','start_otherEnd','end_otherEnd' (coordinates of the interacting restriction fragment)}

\item{grl}{GRangesList containing features with which ints should be annotated.
Names of the grl correspond to the names that will be given to table columns}

\item{minov}{Default:NULL,  minimal overlap (minoverlap in findOverlaps) between otherEnd or bait fragment and the feature}

\item{maxgp}{Default:NULL, maximum gap (maxgap in findOverlaps) between otherEnd or bait fragment and the feature}
}
\value{
interactions file with annotations from GRanges file
}
\description{
annotates bait and otherEnd from a table with interactions (ints) with features within a GRangesList (grl)
}
