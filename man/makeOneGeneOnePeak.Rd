\title{Make one-Gene-one-Peak Interaction Table}
\usage{
makeOneGeneOnePeak(grl, rmapgr, ints, maxgap = 1000, folder = "oneGeneOnePeak")
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{GRangesList containing features with which ints should be annotated.
Names of the grl correspond to the names that will be given to table columns}

\item{rmapgr}{GenomicRanges object containing restriction fragments. IDs must be saved in a column called 'id'}

\item{ints}{chicago data over interactions (as returned by getInts)}

\item{maxgap}{minimum gap for two different peaks/maximum separation for two maxima to be binned together, optional: Default 1000}

\item{folder}{Output folder}
}
\value{
annotated OneGeneOnePeak interaction table as .txt.
}
\description{
This function takes intervals in grl, gives them a unique ID and identifies all interaction with a given interval.
